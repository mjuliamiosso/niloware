        Greetings players,
        These terms of service (the “Terms”) set out the terms and conditions by which Riot Games offers you access to use and enjoy our games, apps, websites and other services (the “Riot Services”). Riot Games is a global gaming company headquartered in Los Angeles with offices and operations around the world. When we say “Riot Games,” we’re referring to the Riot Games entity responsible for providing the Riot Services in your region (see Section 18, below) and these Terms are an agreement between you and that entity.
        Please read these Terms carefully and pay particular attention to these items:
        Dispute Resolution. If you reside in the United States, please read the binding arbitration clause and class action waiver in Part A of Section 16. It affects how disputes between us are resolved.
        Virtual Content. When you click to purchase, earn or are gifted Virtual Content, you only get a license to access Virtual Content. You have no ownership in any of the Virtual Content you unlock and you can’t transfer it to someone else. Virtual Content has no monetary value, is generally game specific and you can’t redeem Virtual Content for any type of “real world” money.
        Refund Policy. You lose the right to change your mind, cancel the order and get a refund if you get immediate access to or download your digital content. There are some exceptions to this rule, but we have a strict policy on refunds. Read about it here.
        User Rules. You agree to follow our User Rules (Section 7). These rules govern both in-game behavior and certain out-of-game conduct while using the Riot Services.
        Regional laws. Some jurisdictions (for example, Australia and New Zealand) may have laws that grant you rights in addition to those described in these Terms, depending on where you access or otherwise use the Riot Services. To the extent the provisions of any applicable laws conflict with any part of these Terms, such provisions will take precedence.
        Attention Parents!
        We provide game rating info on our website about age appropriateness. We also encourage you to supervise your child’s online activities, review the content they are accessing and, as appropriate, monitor their social interactions. For more info on game ratings and content descriptors, please check your local ratings system.</p>
